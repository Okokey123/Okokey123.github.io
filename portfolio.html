    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio page!</h1>
	<br>
	<h3> Here is where all of my projects for AP CS principles 2021 will be shown! </h3>
	<h3> Currently a work in progress. </h3>
	<h2> For the first project, me and Ryan had created a Pacman Esc game in Replit! </h2>

	<h2> <center>This is me and Ryan's final PLTW 1.1.9 Project! We had created a Pacman type of game, where you have to go around (with player input! ) eating all of the coins. We had used the basic turtle methods; however, elevated with our own turtle graphics and definitions.

		<h3> For our 1.2.5 Project, Me and Alex had created a "Donkey Kong" esc platformer game. </h3>

	<h2> <center> We had taken inspiration from the original Donkey Kong game, we had initially attempted to recreate the Donkey Kong game with the moving barrels and everything. However, this had not turned out the way we hoped it to. So, instead we had created it into a normal platformer with a Donkey Kong esc style. </center> </h2>

		<h3> Our 1.3 Scratch Project! Presenting.... Flappy Bird!

	<img style="border:5px double black;"src="images/Scratch_3.png"height="500"alt="Scratch Program Image 3"/>
			</center>
			</br>
	<h2> <center> We had used the coding platform in order to create a Flappy Bird remake. In the actual game, there are three different speeds; normal ( slow ), fast ( advanced ), and extreme. Each one incrementally faster than the last. The goal is to get through all of the pipes without hitting them, attempting to reach the highest score possible. With a variety of different costumes, different backgrounds, animation, sounds, and more we had fullfilled 7 of the requirements for this project.

		<h3> For the 3.1.6 Project, we had done a data organization and interpretation project. <h/3>

	<h2> <center> For the 3.1.6 project, we had been given a single stream full of data from 4 different sensors of a rover on an alien planet, we had been set with the task of finding out which region the data is from. Using our knowledge of the data and the graphs we had deducted that the rover was highly likely to be in the Rocky Mountains region. First and foremost, my partner and I had been given a description of each possible region that the rover could be in, using those descriptions we had created multiple graphs in order to indicate what we were looking for in the actual data of the rover. Next, we separated the single stream of values into different columns of data, in order to figure out which data goes to which sensor. Looking at the graphs, we had interpreted that the Blue graph was the temperature, implying a low temperature in the night / evening, with a sharp increase of temperature as the sun comes out during the day time. The Red graph was our light, meaning that there was a constant amount of light with clouds covering it ( which explains the sharp edges of the graph ). We had also thought that the yellow graph was the movement, implying a minor, yet constant, movement in the region. All of this together in our head made us believe that the rover was in the Rocky Mountains. <h/2>

		<h3> The next project, PLTW 3.2.4, we had done another data organization project. <h/3>
